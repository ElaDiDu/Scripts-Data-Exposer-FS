# Scripts-Data-Exposer-FS
An Elden Ring mod that exposes data to scripts (i.e HKS) to open up their capabilities

## Purpose
This mod introduces new acts/envs to HKS which other mods can of course access, things such as setting event flags, updating magic index for proper use of magic on different inputs, printing to a console and the generics read/write that allow you to traverse pointer chains to get access to nearly everything (e.g max fp, params).

Examplse and how to use are shown in the NewHksInfo.lua file.
